## Executive Summary
The COVID-19 Data Analysis Project aims to comprehensively analyze and interpret COVID-19 death rates and vaccination data for the United States. The project utilized three datasets from trustworthy sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop hypotheses and draw insights. The findings provide valuable information about death rates, age-group vulnerability, underlying conditions, vaccination impact, and the relationship between population density and death rates.

## Data Description
The project utilized three main datasets, namely:
- Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Week Ending Date and State
- COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States, Jurisdiction
- California coronavirus cases and deaths

These datasets include critical information such as COVID-19 deaths by age range, vaccination data, and other relevant statistics.

## Data Cleaning
Python and Basic filtering functions in Tableau were employed to organize and clean the data efficiently.

## General Introduction
The project's goal was to analyze the COVID-19 death rate and vaccination data for the United States. Five hypotheses were formulated and tested using the datasets, covering aspects like death rates between states, age-group comparisons, underlying condition effects, vaccination impact, and population density correlations.

## Insights and Findings
The project uncovered several key insights, including:
- Variation in death rates among different U.S. states.
- Age-group vulnerability, with individuals aged 65 and above experiencing the highest death rates.
- Contrary findings regarding the impact of underlying conditions on death rates.
- Positive correlation between increasing vaccination rates and decreasing death rates.
- Complex relationship between population density and death rates in California counties.

## Conclusion
The findings emphasize the importance of nuanced analysis, considering additional variables for a comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 patterns. The project contributes valuable insights to guide effective public health strategies.
